## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to transfer the Javascript array data and use it to create a new customized table on a website which we also created through the use of HTML. We added filters to be able to pull specific data from the arrays such as date, city, state, etc. 

## Results:

When explaining how to use the new webpage, we can follow along with these steps:
1. Enter the website

## Summary:

A drawback of this new design is such as that it may feel strange to use at first since there is no physical button to click when searching, it automatically does it and it is based on old data. Two recommendations for further development could be such as adding a search button, allowing the searches to not be case sensitive in case to be able to get all the results even with grammatical errors, and making the data come from a live source to stay up to date.
